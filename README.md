# MSAl Android app calling Microsoft graph

The MSAL Android preview gives your app the ability to begin using the
[Microsoft identity platform](https://aka.ms/aaddev) by supporting [Microsoft Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) and [Microsoft Accounts](https://account.microsoft.com) in a converged experience using industry standard OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. 
This sample demonstrates all the normal lifecycles your application should experience, including:

* Get a token for the Microsoft Graph
* Device-wide SSO and Conditional Access support through the Auth Broker
* Choose between Single user mode or Multiple user mode
* How to handle shared device mode
* Refresh tokens automatically
* Call the Microsoft Graph
* Sign out the user

## Scenario

This app is a multi-tenant app meaning it can be used by any Azure AD tenant or Microsoft Account.  It demonstrates how a developer can build apps to connect with enterprise users and access their Azure + O365 data via the Microsoft Graph. 
During the auth flow, end users will be required to sign in and consent to the permissions of the application, and in some cases may require an admin to consent to the app.  The majority of the logic in this sample shows how to auth an end user and make a basic call to the Microsoft Graph.
This app also demonstrates Single user mode and Multiple user mode, in which Single user mode enables shared mode device which can used for Firstline Workers scenario.

For more information on the concepts used in this sample, be sure to read the documentation [link]

> If you are writing an application that will only be used for Firstline Workers on shared devices, we recommend you write your application to only support Single User Mode.
This will increase the security of your application and simplify your development as many features of the SDK wonâ€™t need to be accommodated.
  
> If your app also support multiple accounts as well as shared device mode, you will have to perform type check and cast to the appropriate interface to perform an operation. 

> You can use isSharedDevice() method to determine if an application is in Shared Device Mode. Your app can use this flag to modify UX accordingly. 


## Example

A code snippet from SingleAccountModeFragment class
```
PublicClientApplication.createSingleAccountPublicClientApplication(getContext(),
                R.raw.auth_config_single_account);
```
A code snippet from auth_config_single_account
```
"account_mode" : "SINGLE",
"broker_redirect_uri_registered": true,    
```
## How to run this sample

To run this sample, you'll need:

* Android SDK
* An internet connection

#### Note : If you have older versions of Microsoft Authenticator app installed in your device this sample app maynot run on your device. To make sure that doesnt effect, you should download [] version Microsoft Authenticator on your device.

## Steps to Run

##  Step 1: Register your App  

To begin registering your app, begin at the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/MobileAppReg)

To create an app,  
1. Click `New Registration`. 

2. Name your app, select the audience you're targeting, and click `Register`. 

3. Click `Authentication` > `Add Platform` > `Android`. 
    - Enter the Package Name from your Android studio project. 
    - Generate a Signature Hash. Refer to the portal for instructions.

4. Hit the `Configured` button. Store the ***MSAL Configuration*** for the next steps. 


## Step 2: Clone the code. 

  ```
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-android-native-v2 
  ```   
   Open Android Studio, and select *open an existing Android Studio project*. Find the cloned project and open it. 

## Step 3: Configure the sample code in `auth_config.json` and `AndroidManifest.xml`.

   - Copy and paste the ***MSAL Configuration*** JSON from the Azure portal into `auth_config.json`. 
   - Inside the `AndroidManifest.xml`, replace `android:host` and `android:path` with the same info registered above.
        - `auth_config.json` contains this information as a reference inside the `redirect_uri` field.
        - The Signature Hash should NOT be URL encoded in the `AndroidManifest.xml`. 

     Select *Build* > *Clean Project*. 

## Step 4: Run the sample

Select *Run* > *Run 'app'*.

## Security Library

This library controls how users sign-in and access services. We recommend you always take the 
latest version of our library in your app when possible. We 
use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) so you can control the risk associated with updating 
your app. As an example, always downloading the latest minor version number (e.g. x.*y*.x) ensures 
you get the latest security and feature enhanements but our API surface remains the same. You 
can always see the latest version and release notes under the Releases tab of GitHub.

## Security Reporting

If you find a security issue with our libraries or services please report it 
to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) with as much detail as possible. Your 
submission may be eligible for a bounty through the [Microsoft Bounty](http://aka.ms/bugbounty) 
program. Please do not post security issues to GitHub Issues or any other public site. We will 
contact you shortly upon receiving the information. We encourage you to get notifications of when 
security incidents occur by 
visiting [this page](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dd252948) and subscribing 
to Security Advisory Alerts.
