## About the Sample

The MSAL Android library gives your app the ability to begin using the [Microsoft identity platform](https://aka.ms/aaddev) by supporting [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) and [Microsoft Accounts](https://account.microsoft.com) in a converged experience using industry standard OAuth2 and OpenID Connect protocols.

This sample walks you through the process of integrating authentication with Microsoft Identity Platform (formerly Azure Active Directory for developers) in your android application. In this sample we'd walk you through the code you need to write in the various lifecycle events of your app to achieve the following objectives.

* Sign-in a user
* Device-wide SSO and Conditional Access support through the Auth Broker
* Select between Single Account Mode and Multiple Account Mode
* Get a token for the [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com)
* Call the [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com)
* Sign out the user

## Scenario

This sample app is a [multi-tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/setup-multi-tenant-app) app, which means that it can sign-in users from any Azure AD tenant and Microsoft Accounts.  It also demonstrates how a developer can build apps to connect with enterprise users and access their Azure + O365 data via [Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview).
During the auth flow, the users will be required to sign-in first, if its their first time signing-in to the app, the user would be asked to consent to the [permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-permissions-and-consent) required by the application.

The majority of the logic in this sample shows how to sign-in an end user and make a call to the Microsoft Graph to get basic information about the signed-in user.

## Broker Authentication using MSAL

Microsoft provides applications for every mobile platform that allow for the bridging of credentials across applications from different vendors and for enhanced features that require a single secure place from where to validate credentials. These are called brokers. The brokers available for Android are **Microsoft Authenticator** and **Company Portal**.
[Learn more about Brokers here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-v1-enable-sso-android#single-sign-on-concepts)

The MSAL for Android will automatically use the broker if they are present on the device.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have older versions of **Microsoft Authenticator** app or [Company portal app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune-user-help/install-and-sign-in-to-the-intune-company-portal-app-ios) installed in the device where this sample application will be run, then the user might not be able to test the scenarios presented here. Please make sure that you have installed the latest version of Microsoft Authenticator or Company Portal on your device.

### Single Account Mode

In the `Single Account` Mode, only one user can sign into the application at a time. If the app wants to support just one signed-in user, it is recommended to use the `Single Account` Mode.

The following code snippet from **SingleAccountModeFragment** class shows how the application is set to the `Single Account` Mode in the code:

```java
PublicClientApplication.createSingleAccountPublicClientApplication(getContext(),
                R.raw.auth_config_single_account);
```

In the **auth_config_single_account.json** file, the `account_mode` is set as following:.

```json
"account_mode" : "SINGLE",
```

## Multiple Account Mode

In the `Multiple Account` Mode, the application supports multiple accounts and can switch between accounts of the user and get data from that user's account.

Code snippet from **MultipleAccountModeFragment** class shows how the application is set in the `Multiple Account` Mode in the code:

```java
PublicClientApplication.createMultipleAccountPublicClientApplication(getContext(),
                R.raw.auth_config_multiple_account);
```

## How to run this sample

To run this sample, you'll need:

* Android SDK
* An internet connection
* An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
* One or more user accounts in your Azure AD tenant.

## Steps to Run the app

### Step 1: Clone the code

  From your shell or command line:

```Shell

To explore more about the application, follow on screen options.

> [!NOTE]
> This sample application is configured to run out-of-the-box. To register your own application and run the sample with those settings, follow below steps.

## Register your Own Application (Optional)  

To begin registering your app, start at the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/MobileAppReg)

To **create** an app registration,  

1. Click `New Registration`.

2. Name your app, select the audience you're targeting, and click `Register`.

3. In the `Overview` > `Sign in users in 5 minutes` > `Android`.
    * Click on `Make this changes for me`.
    * Enter the Package Name from your Android Manifest.
    * Generate a Signature Hash. Follow the instructions in the portal.

4. Hit the `Make updates` button. Note the ***MSAL Configuration*** as it is used later in `AndroidManifest.xml` and `auth_config.json`.

**Configure** the sample application with your app registration by replacing the sample code in `auth_config.json` and `AndroidManifest.xml`

1. Copy and paste the ***MSAL Configuration*** JSON from the Azure portal into `auth_config.json`.

2. Inside the `AndroidManifest.xml`, replace `android:host` and `android:path` with the same info saved in above step.
        - `auth_config.json` contains this information as a reference inside the `redirect_uri` field.
        - The Signature Hash should NOT be URL encoded in the `AndroidManifest.xml`.
    Refer [Azure Active Directory Android Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-android) for more details

From menu, select *Build* > *Clean Project* and *Run* > *Run 'app'*.

## About the code

The following files have the code that would be of interest to you.

### SingleAccountModeFragment class

   Contains code showing how the `Single Account` Mode is implemented. The includes authentication, obtaining the token, and making a Graph api call using the obtained token.

   The following steps give you more details.

1. Create a SingleAccount PublicClientApplication:

    ```java
        PublicClientApplication.createSingleAccountPublicClientApplication(getContext(),
        R.raw.auth_config_single_account,
        new IPublicClientApplication.ISingleAccountApplicationCreatedListener() {
            @Override
            public void onCreated(ISingleAccountPublicClientApplication application) {
                  mSingleAccountApp = application;
                ...

    ```

2. Signing in a user:

    ```java
        mSingleAccountApp.signIn(getActivity(), getScopes(), getAuthInteractiveCallback());
    ```

3. Acquiring token:

    * Interactive:

    ```java
            mSingleAccountApp.acquireToken(getActivity(), getScopes(),getAuthInteractiveCallback());
    ```

    * Silent:

    ```java
        mSingleAccountApp.acquireToken(getActivity(), getScopes(), getAuthInteractiveCallback());
    ```

4. Calling Graph API to get basic user details and displaying data:

    ```java
        private void callGraphAPI(final IAuthenticationResult authenticationResult) {
                MSGraphRequestWrapper.callGraphAPIWithVolley(
                        getContext(),
                        graphResourceTextView.getText().toString(),
                        authenticationResult.getAccessToken(),
                        new Response.Listener<JSONObject>() {
                            @Override
                            public void onResponse(JSONObject response) {
                                /* Successfully called graph, process data and send to UI */
                                Log.d(TAG, "Response: " + response.toString());
                                displayGraphResult(response);
                            }
                        },
                        new Response.ErrorListener() {
                            @Override
                            public void onErrorResponse(VolleyError error) {
                                Log.d(TAG, "Error: " + error.toString());
                                displayError(error);
                            }
                        });
            }
    ```

5. Sign-out:

    ```java
        mSingleAccountApp.signOut(new ISingleAccountPublicClientApplication.SignOutCallback() {
                            @Override
                            public void onSignOut() {
                                updateUI(null);
                                performOperationOnSignOut();
                            }
    ```  

    When sign-out is performed it removes the signed-in account and cached tokens from this app.

### MultipleAccountModeFragment class

   Contains code showing how the `Multiple Account` Mode is implemented. The includes authentication and obtaining the token, and making a graph api call using the obtained token.

1. Create a MultipleAccount PublicClientApplication:

    ```java
    PublicClientApplication.createMultipleAccountPublicClientApplication(getContext(),
        R.raw.auth_config_multiple_account,
        new IPublicClientApplication.IMultipleAccountApplicationCreatedListener() {
            @Override
            public void onCreated(IMultipleAccountPublicClientApplication application) {
                    mMultipleAccountApp = application;
                    loadAccount();
            }
    ```

2. Acquiring token:

    * Interactive:

    ```java
    mMultipleAccountApp.acquireToken(getActivity(), getScopes(), getAuthInteractiveCallback());
    ```

    * Silent:

    ```java
    mMultipleAccountApp.acquireTokenSilentAsync(getScopes(),
                            accountList.get(accountListSpinner.getSelectedItemPosition()),
                            AUTHORITY,
                            getAuthSilentCallback());
    ```

3. Get Accounts:

    ```java
          mMultipleAccountApp.getAccounts(new IPublicClientApplication.LoadAccountsCallback() {
                      @Override
                      public void onTaskCompleted(final List<IAccount> result) {
                              accountList = result;
                              updateUI(accountList);
                      }
    ```

4. Remove account:

    ```java
          mMultipleAccountApp.removeAccount(accountList.get(accountListSpinner.getSelectedItemPosition()),
                        new IMultipleAccountPublicClientApplication.RemoveAccountCallback() {
                            @Override
                            public void onRemoved() {
                                Toast.makeText(getContext(), "Account removed.", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT)
                                        .show();

                                /* Reload account asynchronously to get the up-to-date list. */
                                loadAccount();
                            }
    ```
